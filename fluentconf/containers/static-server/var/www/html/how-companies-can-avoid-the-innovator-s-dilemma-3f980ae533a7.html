A product becomes a hit because it resonates with a generation. And as time goes on, that generation matures and is inevitably replaced by a fresh set of customers with distinct tastes and perspectives. The product, a victim of its own success, eventually hits a ceiling.</p><p name="d3a7" id="d3a7" class="graf--p graf-after--p">In technology, the cycle is on constant repeat. Once a consumer product starts to gain a large audience — it risks disruption from another new solution, one that ups the innovation ante. These usurpers then grow and are themselves eventually displaced. That’s the classic pattern of disruption — what Clay Christensen calls the Innovator’s Dilemma.</p><p name="a0a8" id="a0a8" class="graf--p graf-after--p">I&#39;ve had the privilege to witness this cycle thousands of times. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/asethi" data-href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/asethi" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow">After building and growing many Facebook apps, games and mobile apps</a>, I&#39;ve learned that once a product finds or gains a large initial audience, there are two options for achieving large scale growth:</p><ol class="postList"><li name="66f9" id="66f9" class="graf--li graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--li-em">The product evolves and becomes a platform that other companies can integrate into their own products, building specialized use cases for their audience. </em>Facebook launched its platform in 2007 and grew its monthly active users from 50 million to 1.44 billion, a 28.8x increase.</li><li name="6833" id="6833" class="graf--li graf-after--li"><em class="markup--em markup--li-em">The company decides to try and disrupt its own product. Deliberate disruption helps fight off all the other companies (usually startups) who are going after the audience.</em> Apple has created innovative products, such as the iPad, in order to fuel its own growth. One might imagine that the iPad has the potential to take market away from Apple’s own existing products (i.e. Macbook).</li></ol><p name="387e" id="387e" class="graf--p graf-after--li">Often times, both of these things happen. As a result, a consumer eventually gets used to a feature and the shiny new product loses its appeal. Then, something new and novel comes along and the cycle of disruption starts again. For a company to survive long-term, it must own whatever disruptive thing comes next.</p><h3 name="7e96" id="7e96" class="graf--h3 graf-after--p">Disruption is The Only Choice</h3><p name="86d7" id="86d7" class="graf--p graf-after--h3 graf--last">Recently, designer Ben Barry shared a few pages from <a href="http://officeofbenbarry.com/project/facebooks-little-red-book" data-href="http://officeofbenbarry.com/project/facebooks-little-red-book" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow">Facebook’s Little Red Book</a>, in which he explained how consumer companies have successfully innovated to stay relevant.</p></div></div></section><section name="a66e" class=" section--body section--middleCenter section-image--aspectRatioViewport is-imageBackgrounded is-backgrounded is-darkBackgrounded is-aboveSectionCaption"><div class="section-background" data-scroll="aspect-ratio-viewport"contenteditable="false" data-image-id="1*TvQxdyFdX4bH4uCDvtxZKA.jpeg" data-width="1200" data-height="920"><div class="section-backgroundImage"style="background-image: url(https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*TvQxdyFdX4bH4uCDvtxZKA.jpeg);"></div><br></div><div class="section-doubleWidthTable u-table u-ignoreBlock"><div class="u-tableCell u-verticalAlignTop u-ignoreBlock"><div class="section-aspectRatioViewportBottomSpacer u-ignoreBlock"><div class="u-ignoreBlock" style="padding-bottom: 38.3333%;"></div></div><div class="section-doubleWidthTable u-table u-ignoreBlock"><div class="section-contentCell u-tableCell u-ignoreBlock"><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner layoutSingleColumn"><p name="c161" id="c161" class="graf--p graf--first">Facebook’s Little Red Book</p></div></div></div><div class="u-tableCell u-verticalAlignTop u-ignoreBlock"><div class="section-aspectRatioViewportPlaceholder u-ignoreBlock"><div class="u-ignoreBlock" style="padding-bottom: 76.6667%;"></div></div><div class="section-aspectRatioViewportBottomPlaceholder u-ignoreBlock"><div class="u-ignoreBlock" style="padding-bottom: 38.3333%;"></div></div></div></div></div><div class="u-tableCell u-ignoreBlock"><div class="section-aspectRatioViewportCropPlaceholder u-ignoreBlock"><div class="u-ignoreBlock" style="padding-bottom: 76.6667%;"></div></div></div></div><div class="section-captionContent u-ignoreBlock"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--caption"><label name="9ca8" id="9ca8" data-default-value="Type caption for image (optional)" class="graf--sectionCaption graf-after--p graf--last">The Facebook Little Red Book.

Sustainable growth comes from aggressively seeking to kill your cash cow before someone else does. Companies tend to protect what they have instead of trying to destroy it themselves through innovation. Consumer businesses that are willing to cannibalize their existing audience are the ones that can survive in the long-term.</p><p name="f2e8" id="f2e8" class="graf--p graf-after--p">Steve Jobs knew this and Apple’s continuous growth can be attributed to the strategy of cannibalizing an existing audience.</p><figure name="3509" id="3509" class="graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 14px;"><div class="aspect-ratio-fill" style="padding-bottom: 2%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*WzhDeRs44-hyRlXg24dNrg.png" data-width="1200" data-height="24" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*WzhDeRs44-hyRlXg24dNrg.png" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*WzhDeRs44-hyRlXg24dNrg.png"></div></figure><h3 name="9ae6" id="9ae6" class="graf--h3 graf-after--figure">Why Successful Companies Struggle With Innovation</h3><p name="9359" id="9359" class="graf--p graf-after--h3">Inevitably, once there’s a large audience, companies have to disrupt themselves through innovation or they will be victims of their own success.</p><p name="8529" id="8529" class="graf--p graf-after--p">That’s the classic <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0062060244/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0062060244&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hitenism-20&amp;linkId=DLT345FO6DGWY72O" data-href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0062060244/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0062060244&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hitenism-20&amp;linkId=DLT345FO6DGWY72O" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow">Innovator’s Dilemma</a>.</p><p name="e89f" id="e89f" class="graf--p graf-after--p">Clay Christenson’s work isn&#39;t exactly a secret. Yet consumer companies get disrupted time over time because of the powerful inertia that occurs within the cocoon of success. Inside that cocoon, three common beliefs take hold:</p><ol class="postList"><li name="adc0" id="adc0" class="graf--li graf-after--p">Companies think their existing audience will come over to any new product they create.</li><li name="2d7c" id="2d7c" class="graf--li graf-after--li">They assume that the intent of a user can be suited or modified towards any new offering.</li><li name="9645" id="9645" class="graf--li graf-after--li">They believe they can monetize with their existing business model.</li></ol><p name="886c" id="886c" class="graf--p graf-after--li">On the surface these beliefs sound harmless; however, they are as toxic as <a href="http://www.botgard.ucla.edu/html/botanytextbooks/economicbotany/Curare/" data-href="http://www.botgard.ucla.edu/html/botanytextbooks/economicbotany/Curare/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow">curare</a>. They lure companies into thinking that their mission is to protect their existing audience — a deadly mistake. Each consumer product has an audience who signed up with the intent of its specific use case or service. This makes it ineffective to try and get a large percentage of an existing audience over to a new product or service that has a unique intent.</p><h3 name="7350" id="7350" class="graf--h3 graf-after--p">Many Growing Companies Lose Sight of Innovation</h3><p name="1ef3" id="1ef3" class="graf--p graf-after--h3">As companies grow, they hire people to handle the demands of that growth, both to deal and to cope with a larger internal organization. This often leads to a culture of scaling over a culture of innovation. Here’s what commonly happens:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="ceb3" id="ceb3" class="graf--li graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--li-em">The organization breaks into functional silos. </em>Product, sales, marketing, customer support and finance all become their own departments.

Piece by piece, the app goes from being owned by an entire company to being the responsibility of siloed teams. While this allows for the company to solve for the behavior of its existing audience, and these changes serve the company functionally as it scales, they ultimately lead to an environment that’s less innovative.</p><figure name="8a6d" id="8a6d" class="graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 14px;"><div class="aspect-ratio-fill" style="padding-bottom: 2%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*WzhDeRs44-hyRlXg24dNrg.png" data-width="1200" data-height="24" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*WzhDeRs44-hyRlXg24dNrg.png" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*WzhDeRs44-hyRlXg24dNrg.png"></div></figure><h3 name="2167" id="2167" class="graf--h3 graf-after--figure">Solution One: A Family of Brands</h3><p name="3f33" id="3f33" class="graf--p graf-after--h3">It’s hard to innovate on a single, massively popular product. So, successful consumer companies often end up with new ones in addition to their flagship efforts. This transformation from a single product to a family of products occurs when a consumer business reaches a saturation point for its market. With most free consumer products, you see the transformation when the initial core product starts reaching the masses of hundreds of millions of people, or in Facebook’s case, an amazing 1.44 billion monthly active users as of March, 2015. Members of the family may come from acquisition (sometimes a “defensive play”, working to end a threat from a potential disruptor) or internal efforts. In any case, consumer companies end up with a family of product brands, each serving as a family member with different audience intent.</p><p name="c7ea" id="c7ea" class="graf--p graf-after--p">The family of brands strategy is what P&amp;G has used to survive for the last 177 years.

Consider the Kindle: a device that became home to the world’s biggest bookstore, and lured people away from buying physical books. If Amazon didn&#39;t do it, someone else would have. Amazon succeeded with the Kindle by having a maniacal focus on reducing the costs and increasing the speed of delivery. It was a good way to keep innovation central to Amazon — because pioneering a new product category <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">forced</em> innovation.</p><p name="9e18" id="9e18" class="graf--p graf-after--p">Amazon is also a big time participant in the Family of Brands approach. Many of it’s 40+ subsidiaries are separate brands where Amazon’s branding is kept to a minimum. These include Zappos.com, Diapers.cm, audible.com, IMDb.com Woot.com, Fabric.com, Soap.com, Pets.com and many more.</p><p name="f007" id="f007" class="graf--p graf-after--p">Amazon’s innovative strategy of cannibalization and creating a family of brands is working.

Not bad for a company that’s only 21 years old!</p><p name="9753" id="9753" class="graf--p graf-after--p">Of course, these strategies are risky. Netflix is perhaps the most striking example of a company that balances the risks as well as the rewards. First, Netflix successfully shifted its core business from a company that shipped DVDs to people’s home into a streaming media service that works on all of your devices. The result was a paltry auction sale of the incumbent, Blockbuster.</p><p name="ccd4" id="ccd4" class="graf--p graf-after--p">By September of 2011, the transition was made, and Netflix made its strategic play at being a family of brands. Netflix attempted to split up the one brand into two by spinning out the DVD rental business into a new brand. It was called Qwikster.</p><figure name="064a" id="064a" class="graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetLeft graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 525px; max-height: 378px;"><div class="aspect-ratio-fill" style="padding-bottom: 72%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*EvDAhPddeRR0ILCI6Hm_AQ.png" data-width="1009" data-height="726" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*EvDAhPddeRR0ILCI6Hm_AQ.png" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*EvDAhPddeRR0ILCI6Hm_AQ.png"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">Source: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/methodshop/6166107840/" data-href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/methodshop/6166107840/" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="nofollow">https://www.flickr.com/photos/methodshop/6166107840/</a></figcaption></figure><p name="4ba7" id="4ba7" class="graf--p graf-after--figure">It was a disaster, in part because of pricing and in part because its customers simply hated the idea. Netflix CEO Reed Hastings was smart enough to change course; not only did he reverse the decision but he made <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tWK0tW1fig" data-href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tWK0tW1fig" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow">a public apology</a> to customers.</p><p name="906b" id="906b" class="graf--p graf-after--p">Netflix’s real failure at that time was that its new brand wasn&#39;t really an advance: both its old and new brands were about delivering content. But the entertainment business — where Netflix wanted to be — is about the content. Hollywood studios and television networks regard delivery mechanisms as a commodity. But, Netflix realizes, when you have a hit, you own a monopoly on it. People have to come to you. Netflix disrupted its industry by creating the easiest way to watch TV shows and movies online, taking away the opportunity for the entertainment industry to build brands around content and speak to particular audiences through a unique value proposition. For this vertical, the family strategy has historically been all about content. The strategy treats the delivery mechanism (DVDs in the mail or streaming over the Internet) as a commodity.</p><p name="9630" id="9630" class="graf--p graf-after--p">Initially, Netflix didn&#39;t own the content they distributed. While the strategy was instrumental to its creation of a successful platform business, the winning strategy for Netflix was to imitate what’s worked for the networks. Networks such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=HBO" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=HBO" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow">HBO</a> cannibalize their own existing entertainment content with fresh new content. They&#39;ve gotten great at it and the strategy works well for the entertainment industry. Just like in gaming where you&#39;re always trying to create the new hit game, you end up needing to always find the new hit TV series. Each new series becomes a member of your family.</p><p name="b806" id="b806" class="graf--p graf-after--p">And that’s what Netflix did starting slowly with the release of <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">House of Cards</em> in February of 2013 and then accelerating dramatically. They&#39;ve since released about a hundred original programs and it appears that its formula for growth is working. The release of <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">House of Cards</em> Season 1 also started the climb of their stock price from $160 to over $600 (before an upcoming 7 for 1 split). Having passed through the want phase of the <a href="https://medium.com/backchannel/lessons-learned-growing-consumer-products-550fc04c63c2" data-href="https://medium.com/backchannel/lessons-learned-growing-consumer-products-550fc04c63c2" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">consumer product life cycle</a>, now Netflix is in the need phase where it must keep existing customers and attract more. At the risk of upsetting their content partners, they&#39;ve evolved their business to produce their own content, and changed their existing business into an engine of cannibalization.</p></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn"><figure name="121f" id="121f" class="graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetCenter graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 1020px; max-height: 384px;"><div class="aspect-ratio-fill" style="padding-bottom: 37.6%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*y6iOJ2PfDx5faiFEA-r4kg.png" data-width="1360" data-height="512" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*y6iOJ2PfDx5faiFEA-r4kg.png" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*y6iOJ2PfDx5faiFEA-r4kg.png"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">$NFLX</figcaption></figure></div><div class="section-inner layoutSingleColumn"><p name="7dde" id="7dde" class="graf--p graf-after--figure">Because of Netflix’s success, every way that consumers watch video will eventually support binge watching of new seasons.
