I'll be keeping a log of what I did, and the results of the tests and benchmarks I ran in this file. Because, you know, anything can happen during a live coding session, and I want some data to point at and say "If that thing worked, here's how it'd have looked like" in case $#!% happens :)

// TODO: start logging.
